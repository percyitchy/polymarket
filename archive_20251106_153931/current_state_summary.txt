- Script Status: Running (Process ID: 20047)
- Database: 2 wallets collected
- Scraping: 30 pages from monthly overall leaderboard
- Criteria: 40-1000 predictions, 60-99% win rate, ≤10 trades/day

FILES CREATED:
=============
- polymarket_notifier.py (471 lines) - Main script with pagination
- polymarket_notifier.db - SQLite database with wallet data
- polymarket.log - Script execution log
- wallets_70plus_winrate.txt - 64 wallets with 70%+ win rates
- wallets_80_90_winrate.txt - 50 wallets with 80%+ win rates

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
================
1. ✅ Fixed API integration (transactionHash field)
2. ✅ Implemented pagination (30 pages per URL)
3. ✅ Created multiple wallet lists by win rate
4. ✅ Added daily trading frequency filter
5. ✅ Updated alert template with fire emoji
6. ✅ Collected 65 wallets from previous runs

CURRENT CHALLENGE:
=================
- Only 2 wallets meet strict criteria from 500+ leaderboard
- Need to relax criteria or find better data source
- Script is scraping 30 pages but may need different approach

NEXT STEPS AVAILABLE:
====================
1. Relax win rate criteria (remove 99% cap)
2. Increase prediction limit (1000 → 2000+)
3. Use Polymarket API directly
4. Scrape different timeframes (weekly, daily)
5. Focus on specific categories

Script is currently running and monitoring 2 wallets for consensus signals.
