2. WIN RATES TOO HIGH (100% - excluded by 95% limit):
   - Multiple wallets with 100% win rates were excluded
   - This includes many of the top performers from the leaderboard

KEY INSIGHTS:
=============
1. The monthly leaderboard is dominated by extremely high-volume traders
2. Most successful traders have >1000 predictions (excluded by our limit)
3. Many top performers have 100% win rates (excluded by 95% limit)
4. The 2 wallets found represent moderate-volume traders with good but not perfect win rates

RECOMMENDATIONS TO GET MORE WALLETS:
===================================
1. Increase prediction limit from 1000 to 2000+ to include high-volume traders
2. Remove or increase the 95% win rate cap to include perfect performers
3. Consider scraping more pages of the leaderboard (currently only getting top 20-50 per page)
4. Add pagination to scrape deeper into the leaderboard rankings

CURRENT STATUS:
==============
The script is now monitoring these 2 wallets for consensus buying patterns.
Both wallets are actively trading (50 new events detected for each).
